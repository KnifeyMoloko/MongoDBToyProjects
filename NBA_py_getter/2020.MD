# TODO: start with get_scorebaord and it's decorators
# TODO: thin out the db table lists being created and updated by the script. Leave only nba_1920_line_score, nba_1920_east_conference_standings_by_day, nba_1920_westconference_standings_by_day
# TODO: add log table for local logging in Postgres
# TODO: create a function in helpers (or models maybe?) for the creation of the postgres tables for the "first run" option
